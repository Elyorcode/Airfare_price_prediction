# Airfare_price_prediction

I will review the contents of the uploaded notebook and then help you write a README file for your GitHub repository. Let's start by loading and analyzing the notebook.

I'll take a look at the notebook contents first.

The notebook appears to be focused on predicting airfare prices, including data loading, exploratory data analysis, and model training. Based on the initial analysis, here's a structured README for your GitHub repository:

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to forecast airfare prices based on historical data. The dataset includes various features such as gender, customer type, age, type of travel, class, flight distance, and various satisfaction ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- `train_dataset.csv`: The training dataset containing historical flight and price information.
- `test_dataset.csv`: The test dataset used for making predictions.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file for the competition.

### Features
- **Gender**: The gender of the passengers (Female, Male).
- **Customer Type**: Type of customer (Loyal Customer, Disloyal Customer).
- **Age**: The actual age of the passengers.
- **Type of Travel**: Purpose of the travel (Personal Travel, Business Travel).
- **Class**: Travel class of the passengers (Business, Eco, Eco Plus).
- **Flight Distance**: Flight distance for the trip.
- **Inflight Wifi Service**: Satisfaction level with the inflight Wi-Fi service (0: Not Applicable; 1-5).
- **Departure/Arrival Time Convenient**: Satisfaction level with the departure/arrival time.
- **Ease of Online Booking**: Satisfaction level with the ease of online booking.
- **Gate Location**: Satisfaction level with the gate location.
- **Food and Drink**: Satisfaction level with the food and drink.
- **Online Boarding**: Satisfaction level with the online boarding process.
- **Seat Comfort**: Satisfaction level with the seat comfort.
- **Inflight Entertainment**: Satisfaction level with the inflight entertainment.
- **On-board Service**: Satisfaction level with the onboard service.
- **Leg Room Service**: Satisfaction level with the legroom service.
- **Baggage Handling**: Satisfaction level with the baggage handling.
- **Check-in Service**: Satisfaction level with the check-in service.
- **Inflight Service**: Satisfaction level with the inflight service.
- **Cleanliness**: Satisfaction level with the cleanliness.
- **Departure Delay in Minutes**: Minutes of departure delay.
- **Arrival Delay in Minutes**: Minutes of arrival delay.
- **Satisfaction**: Overall satisfaction with the airline (Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied).

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/airfare-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Change directory into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd airfare-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the project, open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Airfare price prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter or JupyterLab.

```bash
jupyter notebook "Airfare price prediction.ipynb"
```

The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Modeling and Analysis
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Predictions

## Results
The results of the model's predictions will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
